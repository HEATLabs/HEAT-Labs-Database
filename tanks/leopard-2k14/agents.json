      "description": "Reaper senses weakness and strikes hard: damage from his main gun, secondary gun, or ramming instantly destroys opponents. He can also load a clip of shells for deadlier critical damage, automatically reloaded after each kill.",
      "story": "A bold fighter who excels at close range, striking swiftly to finish off wounded enemies. A quiet artist with ancient warrior blood, Reaper is a man of few words but deadly moves. He often ignores orders to follow his gut feelings, and somehow it's always the right call. He never rushes, moving with calm grace, like he already knows what's coming next. You'll rarely catch his eye, but when you do, he stares right through you with unnerving confidence. From quick sketches in his notebook to perfect shots at enemies, not a single movement is wasted.",
